# BG Remover

### A web application that removes the background from your image. Using this is application is very simple. The only thing you need to do is just click the `Browse` button and select your image or to just drag and drop the image onto the uploading area, it will automatically detect the image and upload that image onto the server. It will take 10-15 seconds to process the image and send you the response image. After the image got rendered you can that download that image too.
